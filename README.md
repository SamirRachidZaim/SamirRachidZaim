### Hi there 👋

I am data scientist and computational statistician. 

I translate data into solutions using statistics and machine learning to bring insights into health and medical issues. My passion is using data science to help health disparities, rare diseases, and empowering decision-makers with evidence-based solutions. 

- 🔭 I’m currently wrapping up my PhD at the University of Arizona (hire me!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop python machine learning libraries.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven humanitarian/nonprofit initiatives. 
- 📫 How to reach me: send a message!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him (and shortly, Dr.)
- ⚡ Fun fact: All facts are fun, some are just more interesting than others.
